Title: Automated Entity Extraction from Product Images: A Multi-Step Approach
Abstract:
Objective:
This program aims to automatically extract specific entity values, particularly numerical measurements and their associated units, from product images.
Methodology:

Image Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Download images from provided URLs
Apply preprocessing techniques:
a) Grayscale conversion
b) Contrast enhancement
c) Image sharpening


Text Extraction:

Utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) via Tesseract
Implement a two-pass strategy:
a) Initial attempt on unenhanced image
b) Secondary attempt on enhanced image if necessary


Entity Recognition and Extraction:

Employ regex patterns customized for each entity type
Utilize entity-to-unit mappings for validation
Implement unit standardization (short form to full name)


Measurement Selection:

Identify all valid measurements for the target entity
Select the highest value measurement with an allowed unit


Parallel Processing:

Use ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent image processing
Optimize efficiency for large datasets


Error Handling and Logging:

Manage exceptions for image downloads and processing
Provide detailed logging for troubleshooting


Output and Evaluation:

Generate structured output for easy integration
Include optional evaluation metrics:
a) Accuracy
b) Precision
c) Recall
d) F1-score



Key Features:

Adaptive image preprocessing
Robust unit recognition and standardization
Entity-specific measurement validation
Scalable parallel processing
Comprehensive error handling

Conclusion:
This approach offers a scalable and robust solution for extracting specific entity values from product images, combining image processing, OCR, and NLP techniques to achieve accurate results across varied image qualities and entity types.
